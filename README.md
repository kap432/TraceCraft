## About the Project

Global supply chains today suffer from opacity, inefficiencies, and a lack of verifiable provenance. Our *Supply Chain Transparency Network* harnesses the power of blockchain to ensure every step—from raw material sourcing to final delivery—is recorded immutably. Through real-time updates, QR-based tracking, and decentralized certification, stakeholders and consumers alike gain confidence in the authenticity and sustainability of the products they handle and purchase.

## Problem Statement

- *Lack of Transparency:* Difficulty verifying true origin and sustainability claims.
- *Inefficiencies:* Manual processes lead to delays and errors.
- *Limited Accountability:* Tainted records undermine trust.

## Solution Overview

1. *Product Registration:* Manufacturers register items on Ethereum smart contracts, embedding product details and certification metadata. A unique QR code is generated for each product.
2. *Real-Time Tracking:* Logistics partners scan QR codes at checkpoints, logging GPS coordinates and timestamps on-chain. No single party can tamper with the record.
3. *Certifying Authority Integration:* Accredited bodies upload validated sustainability credentials (e.g., Fair Trade, Organic) to IPFS; hashes are linked on-chain for immutable proof.
4. *Consumer Transparency:* End-users scan the QR code to trace the entire journey—view source, certifications, handlers, and final delivery status—all via a sleek front-end dashboard.
5. *Immutable Ledger:* All interactions are permanently stored on a shared ledger, eliminating data silos and fostering trust.

## Key Features

- 🚀 *Immutable Records:* Blockchain ensures tamper-proof tracking.
- 📍 *GPS-Enabled Checkpoints:* Real-time location logs for full visibility.
- 🔗 *IPFS Integration:* Decentralized storage of certificates and documents.
- 📱 *QR Code Interface:* Simple scanning flow for all participants.
- 📊 *Stakeholder Dashboards:* Custom views for manufacturers, carriers, certifiers, and consumers.
